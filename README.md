# Platform-Game

This is a simple little platform game that I made about a year ago.  You can use the arrow keys or the on screen keyboard if you are on a touch device.

This game was built using the Quintus framework.  Check out their website [http://www.html5quintus.com/](http://www.html5quintus.com/)
